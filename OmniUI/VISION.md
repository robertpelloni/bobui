# OmniUI Vision: The Universal Interface Standard

## The Ultimate Goal
OmniUI is designed to be the definitive successor to both Electron and traditional C++ GUI frameworks. It combines the raw performance and stability of **Qt 6**, the multimedia prowess of **JUCE**, and the developer experience of modern web frameworks (TypeScript/QML).

## Core Pillars
1.  **Unified Runtime**: Write once in TypeScript/QML, deploy natively to Desktop, Mobile, and WebAssembly with zero code changes.
2.  **Audio-First Architecture**: Built-in support for real-time audio graphs, DSP processing, and MIDI sequencing, making it the default choice for creative apps.
3.  **Extensibility**: A robust plugin architecture allows the community to extend the framework with shared libraries (C++) or QML modules.
4.  **Developer Experience**: A CLI-driven workflow (`omni`) that handles scaffolding, dependency management, building, testing, and deployment.

## Future Roadmap
- **v7.0**: Vulkan/Metal backend optimization for 3D rendering.
- **v8.0**: Cloud-native collaboration features (multi-user editing).
- **v9.0**: AI-assisted UI generation (Text-to-UI).
